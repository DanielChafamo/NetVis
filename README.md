# NetVis
visualizing networks

Net*works 1.0 is a graphical representation of changes in the social network of stroke patients at
3 and 6 months after an incident of ischemic stroke. The aim of the project is to prototype
a visual representation of the transformation of social networks of stroke patients.
The project has its inception in a study conducted
by the Dhand Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital examining the social aspect of stroke recovery.
The study used a quantitative assessment tool to parametrize different facets of a patient's
social network and analyzed the relationship between the structure of patients' social network
and their recovery. Drawing upon the quantitative representation of social networks generated
by the study, this project builds a graphical representation of each patient's social network
over the course of 6 months post stroke.
